1. sequence of events with 2 threads that can lead to a key being missing.

if two thread concurrently call 
insert(key, value, &table[i], table[i]);
with the same arguments(the table is a global variables, can be seen between threads)
Assume thread1 insert its key into table[i], then thread2 insert its key into table[i]
the key of thread1 will be missed.

2. The breakpoint may (or may not) be triggered before you even run uthread. How could that happen?
